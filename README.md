# SAM2 Object Tracking CV Assessment - README

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates robust object detection and tracking using the SAM2 model. It is designed for use in Google Colab and includes:
- System setup and environment checks
- Automated dependency installation
- Download and validation of required models and datasets
- Initialization of the SAM2 model (with GPU/CPU fallback)
- Complete object detection and tracking pipeline
- Visualization of results
- Comprehensive testing and benchmarking

## How to Run This Notebook

### 1. Open in Google Colab
- **Do NOT run locally.**
- Upload the notebook (`SAM2_Object_track.ipynb`) to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

### 2. Enable GPU
- Go to `Runtime` > `Change runtime type` > Set **Hardware accelerator** to `GPU`.

### 3. Run All Cells in Order
- Start from the top and run each cell in order (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6).
- **Wait for each cell to finish before running the next.**

### 4. Troubleshooting
- If any cell fails, go to `Runtime` > `Restart runtime`, then start again from Cell 1.
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection for downloading dependencies and datasets.

### 5. Expected Output
- The notebook will:
  - Detect and track objects between images
  - Visualize bounding boxes and masks
  - Print a success message if the assessment is completed

### 6. Testing
- After running all main cells, run the final testing cell to validate the pipeline on multiple objects.
- The notebook will report test results and performance benchmarks.

## Notes
- **All dependencies are installed automatically.**
- **All required files are downloaded automatically.**
- Designed to be robust: if something fails, follow the troubleshooting steps above.

## Submission
- Once you see the final success message, your implementation is ready for submission.

**For any issues, re-read the instructions in the notebook and follow the troubleshooting tips.**
